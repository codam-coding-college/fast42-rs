# Fast42 - Rust Edition
For dev:
- Initialize your `secrets.yaml` file in the root of the repo using the template from `secrets_example.yaml`
- Make sure your API keys have the `Certified App` role OR change the rate limits in the tests accordingly
- You should now be able to run the tests against the 42API
